# Use `node_keys` and `way_keys` for faster tilemaker builds (Oct 6, 2024)

_(Return to the [blog homepage](/blog/).)_

`tilemaker` lets map designers create custom `.mbtiles` or `.pmtiles` files by
authoring a Lua script. For every OpenStreetMap node, way and relation, you
have the chance to interrogate it, include it in your map, or ignore it.

Imagine that you want to print out the names of all the mountains and
railways in North America. You write a script like this:

```lua
function node_function()
  if Find('natural') == 'peak' and Find('name') ~= '' then print(Find('name')) end
end

function way_function()
  if Find('railway') ~= '' and Find('name') ~= '' then print(Find('name')) end
end
```

You'd think it'd be fast, right? If I run it on [GeoFabrik's north-america.osm.pbf](https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america.html), it
takes 105 seconds and uses 12 GB of RAM. What gives?!

# The OpenStreetMap element model

All OpenStreetMap elements are one of three things:

- Nodes
- Ways
- Relations

A node is a point on the map. Ways are made up of nodes. Relations are made up
of nodes, ways, or other relations.

These elements are stored in a special file format called `PBF`. They're often
stored such that all nodes come first, then all ways, then all relations.

This means that `tilemaker` needs to load all nodes, just in case they're
later used by some way. Ditto for loading all ways: they might be used by
some relation.

Aha -- so even though we only care about mountains and railways, `tilemaker`
doesn't know this and is faithfully loading everything just in case.

# `node_keys` and `way_keys`: only load the things you need

We can hint to `tilemaker` what sorts of things we care about by the `node_keys`
and `way_keys` variables:

```lua
node_keys = {'natural=peak'}
way_keys = {'railway'}

function node_function()
  if Find('natural') == 'peak' and Find('name') ~= '' then print(Find('name')) end
end

function way_function()
  if Find('railway') ~= '' and Find('name') ~= '' then print(Find('name')) end
end
```

The syntax is straightforward:

- a tag name, such as `railway` includes any element that has the tag, regardless of its value
- a tag name and value combination, such as `natural=peak` includes any element that has a `natural` tag with `peak` as its value

An element is included if it matches any of the filters. For example, `node_keys = {'natural=peak', 'shop=bicycle'}` would include mountains and bike shops -- not just bike shops located atop mountains.

After making this change and re-running the script, we see that it now takes
only 48 seconds (-55%) and 2.2 GB of RAM (-82%) -- nice!

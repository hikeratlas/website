# About Hiker Atlas

_(Return to the [homepage](/).)_

Anger and hubris. Like most good things, these two emotions drove me to build Hiker Atlas.

**Anger**: despite being a paying AllTrails subscriber, I somehow got my paid account on their WAF blacklist. It's been fixed, but at the time, it felt absurd. The data is mostly open source or crowd-sourced. I'm _paying them_ for this privilege, and yet they block me?

**Hubris**: hey, they're just showing open source information, how hard could it be?

Turns out, it's a little involved. This blog documents my journey as I learn about open-source cartography, circa 2024. Hope it's helpful to someone!

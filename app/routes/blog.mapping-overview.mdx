Modern digital maps are "slippy maps". Users expect to be able to drag to pan seamlessly, to scroll or pinch-zoom to scale, and perhaps even to rotate it.

Supporting those operations means that modern maps are **vector** maps, whose features are digitally composited and rendered on-demand, not **raster** maps, whose features are presented as static, pre-rendered PNGs.

The globe is huge. If you care only about Tijuana, it makes no sense to ship you data about far-flung cities such as Tokyo and Toronto.

This means there needs to be some way to address the different parts of the globe. Thus, we have **tiles**.

There is a standard container format for vector maps: the MapBox vector tile.

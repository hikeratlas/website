# Cartographic generalization: prioritizing features with QRank (Feb 3, 2024)

_(Return to the [blog homepage](/blog/).)_

[Cartographic generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartographic_generalization) is how a mapmaker picks what to show a user on a map when the map just isn't big enough to show it all.

Consider a map of Washington state. If we were to show all the [key:place](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:place) nodes, even without labels, it's a big mess, with many overlapping places:

<div className="flex justify-center items-center">
  <img src="/washington-places.png"/>
</div>

This post will explore how to do simple generalization using [tilemaker](https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker) and Wikidata's [QRank](https://qrank.wmcloud.org/) data.

# The map schema and styles

All the maps on this page use the same style, and (mostly!) the same, simple schema:

## Schema

The [schema](https://github.com/hikeratlas/qrank-demo/blob/main/all.json) declares two layers:

1. `boundaries`, which contains state boundaries as lines
2. `places`, which contains places (e.g., villages, towns, cities) as points


## Style

The style:

1. draws the state boundary
2. labels as many places as it can, scaling the font according to an optional importance key

# Attempt 1: Simplest possible thing (`cities`)

Hey, maybe we don't need to do any generalization. Let's write a Lua profile that emits the state boundary and all the `place` nodes.

Maybe it just works, looks great, and we can knock off for the day. The Lua looks like this:

```lua
node_keys = {'place'}

function node_function()
	local name = Find('name')
	if name == '' then return end

	Layer('places')
	Attribute('name', name)
end

function way_function()
end

function relation_scan_function()
	if Find('boundary') == 'administrative' and Find('admin_level') == '4' then
		Accept()
	end
end

function relation_function()
	if Find('boundary') == 'administrative' and Find('admin_level') == '4' then
		Layer('boundaries')
	end
end
```

We'd expect the map is not going to look great... and, well, see for yourself:

<div className='flex justify-center items-center'><div className='relative w-4/5 h-[80vh]'>
  <Map
    zoom={6}
    lat={47.521}
    lng={-120.562}
    showTileBoundaries={true}
    minZoom={6}
    maxZoom={10}
    maxBounds={[-125, 45, -116, 49.5]}
    style="https://public.hikeratlas.com/blog/cartgen1/cities.json"
    />
</div></div>

# Attempt 2: Limit the number of features (`cities-limit`)

One obvious problem with the previous map: there are _way_ too many places labelled at low zooms.

Adjust the `places` layer to have `feature_limit` and `feature_limit_below` settings:

```json
"places": {
    "zindex": 2,
    "minzoom": 6,
    "maxzoom": 10,
    "feature_limit": 5,
    "feature_limit_below": 10
}
```

This tells tilemaker to put at most 5 places in each tile. If the user wants to see more, they can zoom in. It's a little better:

<div className='flex justify-center items-center'><div className='relative w-4/5 h-[80vh]'>
  <Map
    zoom={6}
    lat={47.521}
    lng={-120.562}
    showTileBoundaries={true}
    minZoom={6}
    maxZoom={10}
    maxBounds={[-125, 45, -116, 49.5]}
    style="https://public.hikeratlas.com/blog/cartgen1/cities-limit.json"
    />
</div></div>


# Attempt 3: Use OSM tags to prioritize features

Now that the map isn't cluttered, we can actually read all the labels.

And we notice that many that we'd expect are missing:

- Seattle, home of Starbucks, multiple pro sports teams and a popular setting for films
- Redmond, home of Microsoft
- Olympia, the capital of Washington state
- Forks, setting of the popular Twilight series
- Spokane, a major population centre in eastern Washington

It'd be reasonable if some are missing... but in fact, they're all missing. What gives?

tilemaker is simply taking 5 arbitrary items for its feature limit. We need to tell tilemaker how to rank the features.

Let's rework our `node_function` to use [the place=*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:place) tag -- items with a higher `ZOrder` value will be preferred by tilemaker:

```lua
function node_function()
	local name = Find('name')
	if name == '' then return end

	Layer('places')
	Attribute('name', name)
	local rank = 1
	local place = Find('place')
	if place == 'hamlet' then rank = 2 end
	if place == 'town' then rank = 3 end
	if place == 'village' then rank = 4 end
	if place == 'city' then rank = 5 end
	ZOrder(rank)
end
```

...giving us this map:

<div className='flex justify-center items-center'><div className='relative w-4/5 h-[80vh]'>
  <Map
    zoom={6}
    lat={47.521}
    lng={-120.562}
    showTileBoundaries={true}
    minZoom={6}
    maxZoom={10}
    maxBounds={[-125, 45, -116, 49.5]}
    style="https://public.hikeratlas.com/blog/cartgen1/cities-osm.json"
    />
</div></div>

Looking better! The big cities we care about are present -- `Seattle`, `Tacoma` and `Spokane`.

There are still some issues:

- [Olympia](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/238005), the state capital, is missing, despite being a `place=city`. Surely it's more important than Yakima or Vancouver.
- The west coast of Washington fits in a tile that has no cities. Thus, we see `place=village` items like Wa'atch and Moclips. They stick out by comparison to proper cities like Seattle.

Maybe we could add some heuristics to resolve these concerns:

- Maybe we could give cities a boost based on population. D'oh--Olympia is smaller than both Yakima and Vancouver.
- Olympia has the `capital=4` tag, indicating that it's a state capital. Maybe we could give any capital a boost.
- Maybe we could say that no `place=village` should ever be visible at low zooms.

But as we start to explore that, it feels like we'll always have to tweak rules. Maybe some `place=village`s are noteworthy enough to appear at low zooms, for example.

Worse, what happens when we think about other features we might like to show on the map? All of our rules are `place` specific. They won't generalize to mountain peaks, bodies of water, etc.

# Attempt 4: Use QRank to prioritize features

Luckily, there's another option. Many OSM items are linked to a [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) item. Many of those items are linked to Wikipedia pages.

Could we drive feature selection by how much "mindshare" the feature has, as measured by visits to Wikipedia?

Yes! It turns out to be straight-forward. Wikimedia hosts the [Wikidata QRank](https://qrank.wmcloud.org/) project. It's a CSV with scores for many Wikidata items, based on pageviews. I host a [QRank SQLite db](https://github.com/hikeratlas/qrank) and [qrank lua module](https://github.com/hikeratlas/basemap/blob/main/slices/qrank.lua) that provide for easy integration into tilemaker.

Let's adjust our `node_function` further:

```lua
function node_function()
	local name = Find('name')
	if name == '' then return end

	Layer('places')
	Attribute('name', name)
	ZOrder(qrank.get(Find('wikidata')))
end
```

Now our map looks like:

<div className='flex justify-center items-center'><div className='relative w-4/5 h-[80vh]'>
  <Map
    zoom={6}
    lat={47.521}
    lng={-120.562}
    showTileBoundaries={true}
    minZoom={6}
    maxZoom={10}
    maxBounds={[-125, 45, -116, 49.5]}
    style="https://public.hikeratlas.com/blog/cartgen1/cities-qrank.json"
    />
</div></div>

Hmmmm. On the one hand, Forks and Olympia now appear. That's excellent.

On the other hand, Index, Aberdeen, and Cheney now also appear. Unfortunately, this seems to be a downside of QRank: it confuses things with similar names. The Wikipedia page for [Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index) is a disambiguation page, with one of the options being the page for Index, WA. I suspect QRank is summing up the popularity of all of the entries on the disambiguation page, giving Index, WA an unfair advantage over other cities. I imagine Aberdeen is getting a boost from its much more famous Scottish peer, and Cheney a boost from a former US politician.

Perhaps someone will come along and fix QRank? Until then, it seems like we'll still need some hand-tuned heuristics.

# Conclusion

Generalization is necessary to avoid a cluttered map. Ranking and limiting the number of features shown is one possible generalization technique. The ranking can either be based on a rules system, or based on an external signal of importance.

In both cases, you'll often need a human in the loop who actually looks at the result and makes some judgment calls about whether it's good enough.
